# 🚀 Itransition Frontend Internship Tasks

This repository contains the solutions developed as part of the **Frontend Developer internship at Itransition**.  
Each task is designed to evaluate and strengthen skills in **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **code optimization**, **algorithms**, and general development best practices.

All solutions are written in TypeScript, with a focus on modular, readable, and efficient code. Tasks are evaluated by an automated Discord bot that checks for correctness, performance, and file size.
